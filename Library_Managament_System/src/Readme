*******How each concept is used********
1. Classes and Objects: Modelled Book, Member, and LendingRecord as classes encapsulating relevant data
2. Enums: BookStatus enum used for managing book availability status clearly
3. Generics: Created a generic Repository<T> class to manage collections of different entity types(Book, Member, LendingRecord)
4. Exception Handling: Defined custom exceptions like bookNotAvailableException, memberNotFoundException, and overdureBookException
5. Collections Framework: Used HashMap to store and access books and members by their IDs efficientlyand also Used ArrayList to maintain lending records for sequential operations because there i have stored ID in the form of LR1, LR2, LR3 and so on
6. Comparable: Implemented Comparable<Book> to allow natural ordering by title
7. Streams & Lambda Expressions: Applied streams for filtering and processing collections with concise syntax, e.g., filtering available books or finding overdue loans.
8. Multithreading: Implemented a background thread overdueMonitor to periodically check lending records for overdue books without disturbing the main thread input/output.
